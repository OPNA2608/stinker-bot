Don't mess up my programs of SidWiz

Ever since that day I got hurt by YetYar
I've been living a doxer life
While playing nights away at 8-Bit Panda
I've learned this magic
I'm sorry!

Never love SidWiz seriously
Love is just a SN76489A
If I'm having fun, that's enough
Fancy sound chips and waveforms that decorate my closed mind
They're my friends to ease loneliness!


(guitar solo)


Ironically every guy who wants to help me looks like him for some reason
That provokes my memories
Even if I drop a glass and suddenly fill my eyes with tears
Don't ask me why!

Never love SidWiz seriously

If I'm having fun, that's enough
Fancy sound chips and waveforms that decorate my closed mind
They're my friends to ease loneliness!

When I fall asleep on a FamiTracker session late at night
Only LEDs shine mysteriously
That I'm a woman as cold as ice
Even if you hear a voice whispering so
Don't worry!

I'm just playing games
I know that's sidwiz love
Dance to the sidwiz beat
